# Cards

This program simulates a 1k HP opponent which summons increasingly more powerful monsters at a cap of 50/50

The idea is to play your cards physically in front of the AI opponent, and keep track of your own cards and effects. Apply damage to AI accordingly. You can assume the AI attacks the most important monsters you control, or just random monsters you control. 

Please suggest added features to improve testing.
